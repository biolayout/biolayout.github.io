BioLayout is a powerful open-source visual analytics platform designed and developed to aid the interpretation of large and complex datasets. 

BioLayout can create and visualise networks from any table of numeric or discrete data values and display the often large and complex graph structures that result. It can also be used to visualise and analyse any data that is already in the form of a network.
